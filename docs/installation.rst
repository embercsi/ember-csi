Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Ember-CSI has the following requirements:

- Operating system: A Red Hat Linux distribution (support for other distributions is possible but not currently provided by the project):
  - Centos 7 and Centos 8
  - RHEL 7 and RHEL 8
  - Fedora

- Container Orchestrator: Both Kubernetes and OpenShift are supported:
  - Openshift: Recommended version 4.6 or newer. Supported from version 4.3 onward.
  - Kubernetes: Recommended version 1.17 or newer. Supported from version 1.16 onward.

- Storage solution: Access and credentials to a `supported storage solution <index.html#supported_drivers>`_.

- Network: Network connections must be setup appropriately.
  - Controller nodes: Must have access to the storage management interface.  Some drivers require access to the storage data network as well.
  - Worker nodes: Must have access to the storage data network.

- Services: Depending on the driver and the configuration we may need additional services running on worker nodes and in some drivers controller nodes.

  - iSCSI: For iSCSI drivers the iSCSI initiator, `iscsid` provided by the `iscsi-initiator-utils` package must be configured and running on the host.

  - Multipathing: When selecting multipathing on iSCSI and FC drivers we'll need to have `multipathd`, provided by the `device-mapper-multipath` package, configured and running on the host.


OpenShift
---------

To eliminate configuration and deployment complexities and the errors that come with them, the recommended mechanism to deploy Ember-CSI is using its operator, which makes installing Ember-CSI a simple and intuitive process.

After logging in the OpenShift console as an administrator we go to the OperatorHub:

.. image:: img/install/01-operatorhub.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

Then we search for the Ember-CSI operator and click on it:

.. image:: img/install/02-operatorhub-search-ember.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

If we are installing the Community Operator we'll be required to confirm that we understand the implications.  We click ``Continue``:

.. image:: img/install/03-confirm-community.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

And we are presented with the Ember-CSI Operator page, where we click ``Install``:

.. image:: img/install/04-install-1.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

And then ``Install`` again:

.. image:: img/install/05-install-2.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

This will trigger the download and execution of the operator container image. It will take a couple of seconds, and in the meantime we'll see that the installation is in progress and maybe a couple of weird entries saying at the beginning:

.. image:: img/install/06-installing.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

Once the operator reaches the ``Succeeded`` status we click on it:

.. image:: img/install/07-succeeded.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

Inside the Ember-CSI operator page we create a new ``Storage Backend`` instance:

.. image:: img/install/08-create-storage-banckend.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

Backends can be configured using YAML, but this is a cumbersome process, so it's usually only used on automated processes such as CI systems, and the Ember-CSI team recommends using the form interface when doing things manually, which is the default on OpenShift 4.5.

In the form we should change the *name* field from *default* to a unique and meaningful name to identify this backend. Then go to the *Driver* dropdown and select the name of our storage backend.  After selecting the appropriate driver the relevant configuration options for the selected driver will be displayed.

.. image:: img/install/09-name-and-driver.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

After setting the configuration options we click *Create* at the botom of the page:

.. image:: img/install/10-create-backend.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

And a new *EmberStorageBackend* entity will be created.  Don't wait for the *Status* to change, since it won't:

.. image:: img/install/11-EmberStorageBackends.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center


We can see that the deployment is complete going to *Stateful Sets*, *Daemon Sets*, and *Replica Sets* pages in the *Workloads* section to see that the deployed pods are running:

.. image:: img/install/12-StatefulSet.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

.. image:: img/install/13-DaemonSet.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

.. image:: img/install/14-ReplicaSets.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

We can also check that a new *Storage Class* has been created in *Storage* > *Storage Classes*. The name of the new class will be *example.ember-csi.io* where *example* will be the name we gave to the *Storage Backend* in the form:

.. image:: img/install/15-StorageClass.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

We can set this *Storage Class* as the default class by going to its actions and selecting *Edit Annotations*:

.. image:: img/install/16-edit-annotations.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

And then adding key `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` with the value of `true`.

.. image:: img/install/17-default-sc.png
   :class: boxed-img
   :align: center

.. warning:: If we already have a default and we want to change it to this one, we'll need to modify the current default by removing the annotation or setting it to `false`.

If we have configured everything right we'll now be able to use our storage solution into OpenShift using the new ``StorageClass`` that was created by the operator.  In the `usage section <usage.html>`_ there is information on how to use the new Storage Backend.

If you see problems in the new *Stateful*, *Daemon*, or *Replica Sets*, please refer to the `troubleshooting guide <troubleshooting.html>`_ for details on how to resolve installation issues.
